## 2. Consumers


---



**General assumptions**: Consumers are rational!

- Maximize their own "utility"
- Understand all aspects of the market
- Unlimited computational power


---

### Preferences in the partial equilibrium framework

- Partial model: consider one good $x$ as a "tiny" part of the economy

- Bundle everything else together and call it "money" (denoted by $m$)

- That the market for $x$ is negligable implies...
  - **negligable wealth effects**: tiny portion of income allocated to $x$
  - **price independence**: change in the price for $x$ does not change prices in rest of economy and vice versa.
- These assumptions motivate "quasi-linear" preferences of consumers 
---
### Quasi-linear utility model

In a quasi-linear utility model, consumers' preferences are represented by

$$\begin{aligned}U(x,m) = u(x)+m\end{aligned}$$

  - $x$ is the good
- $m$ is money (= everything else)
- $p$ is the market price for $x$
- $u$ is increasing and concave (=inverse u-shape)

### Individual demand in quasi-linear model

<br>

Consumer $i$ maximises  utility:

  $$\max_{x,m}\ u(x)+m  $$
  subject to the budget constraint 
  $$px+m=I$$

  where $I$ is the given income of the consumer.

---
Unconstrained problem:
 $$\max_{x}\ u(x)-px+I  $$
First-order condition
$$u'(x)=p$$
<br>

The demand of this consumer is a function $x^*(p)$ such that $u'(x^*(p))=p$ for all $p$

#### Fundamental Law of Demand

How does demand react to price changes?

- Recall: demand function $x^*(p)$ solves $u'(x^*(p))=p$
- Suppose the price increases: $\hat p>p$, so that $u'(x^*(p))<\hat p$
- $u$ is concave, so $u'(x)$ decreases in $x$
- Therefore: $x^*(\hat p)<x^*(p)$ 

Decreasing demand function:  **Fundamental Law of Demand** 


---
### Aggregate Demand



- Suppose $n$ individuals in the market with demands $x_1^*(p)$, $x_2^*(p)$, ..., $x_n^*(p)$
- **Aggregate demand** = sum of individual demands 
$$
    D(p)=x_1^*(p)+...+x_n^*(p)=\sum_{i=1}^n x^*_i(p).
$$
- If identical preferences $x_i^*(p)=x^*(p)$, then $D(p)=n x^*(p).$

--- 




### Inverse demand

If demand is strictly decreasing, we can invert it:

- **Demand curve:** quantity $q=D(p)$ demanded at price $p$.

- **Inverse demand function:** price $p=P^D(q)$ such that consumers demand $q$. 

Graphically, this corresponds to mirroring the demand curve along the $45^o$ line.

### Inverse demand and marginal utility

For simplicity, suppose there are n identical consumers. 

Recall that for each $p$, the demand function of each consumer solves:
$$u'(x^*(p))=p$$

For given $q$, we have $x^*(p)=q/n$, and $p=P^D(q)$, so we can write
$$
u'(q/n)=P^D(q)
$$

**Lesson:** 

    For a given aggregate demand q, the inverse demand measures the corresponding 
    consumers' marginal utility

**Exercise:** Let a consumer's quasi-linear utility function be given by 
$$U(x,m)=u(x)+m$$ 
where $u(x)=x-x^2/2$.
1. Verify that $u''(x)<0$ and calculate the consumer's demand function.
2. Suppose there are 2 consumers with quasi-linear utility $U(x,m)$. Calculate Aggregate Demand.
3. Calculate the inverse demand.
