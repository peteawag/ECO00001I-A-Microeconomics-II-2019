## 3. Firms

### Profit maximisation and cost functions

Assumptions:
- Firms convert money into the consumption good
- The cost of producing an amount $q$ of the good is given by a cost function $C(q)$
- Firms are negligable in size compared to the market (= price-takers)
- Maximize profits


---
### Cost Functions

The total cost of production is the sum of fixed and variable costs
$$
C(q)=c(q)+F
$$

where
-  $F$: fixed costs, e.g., set-up costs
-  $c(q)$: costs that vary with output, e.g., labor.






---


**Marginal cost**: the cost of an additional (infinitesimal) unit of output; the slope of the cost curve at a given output level
$$
MC(q):=c'(q)
$$


**Average cost**: "cost per unit".  For $q>0$ the firm's average total cost function is
$$
AC(q)=\frac{c(q)}{q}+\frac{F}{q}
$$
**Notation**: we write $AVC_j$ for the *average variable cost* and $AFC_j$ for the *average fixed cost*.




---
### Convexity of costs

We typically assume that the cost function is convex: $C''(q)>0$

Reflects **Law of diminishing returns from production**: Using production processes more intensively makes it over-proportionally less efficient

Convexity of costs implies
- profit maximisation problem has a unique solution
- marginal cost increasing 
- average cost curve has an inverse u-shape
- marginal cost curve and intersects average cost at its minimum.

---
**Why intersections marginal cost the average cost at its minimum??**

- Average cost is $AC(q)=C(q)/q$
- If we produce one more item 
    - at a price below average cost, then the new average cost will be lower
    - at a price above average cost, then the new average cost will be higher
- With convex cost, $MC$ is increasing, so $MC$ and $AC$  must intersect once, at the minimum of $AC$

### Individual supply of the firm
<br>

- Firm maximises profits:
$$
\max_q \pi(q)=pq-C(q)
$$
- The first-order condition for optimal output is 
$$
p=C'(q)
$$
- The supply of the firm is a function $y^*(p)$ such that $p=C'(y^*(p))$ for all $p$. 



---

### Aggregate supply


- Suppose $m$ firms in the market with supplies $y_1^*(p)$, $y_2^*(p)$, ..., $y_n^*(p)$
- **Aggregate supply** = sum of individual supplies 
$$
    S(p)=y_1^*(p)+...+y_n^*(p)=\sum_{j=1}^n y^*_j(p).
$$
- If identical supply functions: $y_i^*(p)=y^*(p)$, then $S(p)=m y^*(p).$

---

### Properties of aggregate supply 

- If each $c_j$ is convex, then $S(p)$ is increasing!  **Intuition:** if $p$ increases, produce additional units until marginal cost reaches the new price  
- Inverse supply: we can invert $S(p)$ and obtain a function $P^S(q)$ which gives the price that induces a given supply $q$.

---

**Exercise:** Consider the cost function 
$$
C(q)=10+\frac{q^2}{2}
$$

1.  Draw  marginal cost, average cost average variable cost and the average fixed cost corresponding to $C(q)$
2.  Derive the firm's indidivual supply function
3.  Suppose there are 10 firms. Find the Aggregate Supply.
