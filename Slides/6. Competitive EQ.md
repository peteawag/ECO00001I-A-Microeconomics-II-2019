## 6. Competitive Equilibrium

---

###  Competitive Equilibrium

- We now take the aggregate demand and supply function to characterize market equilibria. 

- **Basic idea:** find a price such that aggregate demand meets aggregate supply.

- Formally, we want find a price $p$ such that $D(p)=S(p)$
- This is called the "market clearing condition".

### Short-run competitive market equilibrium
<br>
We first consider competitive equilibrium in the short-run. 

Short-run: 
 - Fixed cost are sunk, so firms ignore them
 - No entry of new firms
 - No exit of existing firms


---


**Definition**: A **short-run competitive market equilibrium** consists of a price $p^*$ and an allocation $(x_1^*,\ldots, x_n^*)$ of individual demands and an allocation $(y_1^*,\ldots, y_m^*)$ of individual supplies such that

-  $D(p^*)=S(p^*)$,
-  $x_i^*$ maximizes consumer $i$'s utility at price $p^*$ for each $i$, 
-  $y_j^*$ maximizes the profit of firm $j$ at price $p^*$ for each $j$.

### Properties of the competitive equilibrium: 


- In equilibrium, the market clears 
    - Each buyers receives the quantity she demands
    - Each firm sells the quantity it wants to supply 
-  There is neither excess demand nor excess supply     ยง
- There is no way to improve the outcome! $\to$ Efficiency!

---


### Long-run equilibria

- Does the fact that equilibria are efficient rule out firm profits or losses? No! 
- Not a stable equilibrium in the long-run

Long-run equilibrium allows for entry and exit: 

  -  profits attract new firms, supply increases, market price falls
  -  lfirms who shut down exit, supply falls and market price increases

$\rightarrow\,$ profits or losses to disappear in the long-run*. 




---

**Definition:** A **long-run competitive equilibrium** consists of a price $p^*$, a number of firms $m^*$, an allocation of demands $(x_1^*,\ldots, x_n^*)$ of individual demands and an allocation $(y_1^*,\ldots, y_m^*)$ of individual supplies such that such that $(p^*,x^*,y^*)$ is a short-run equilibrium and 
$$
\pi_j^*(p^*)=0
$$
for all $j=1,2, \ldots,m$.

**Losses in the short run**

- Average cost above price
- Firms make losses 


$\Rightarrow$ firms exit!


---

**Difference between short-run and long-run in short:**
- Short-run equilibrium: $MC=p$
- Long-run equilibrium: $MC=AC=p$ 

Or in words:
- Short-run: firms only consider marginal cost ignore fixed consists
- long-run: firms take marginal and fix cost into account

**Profits in the short run**

- Average cost below price
- Firms make profits 


$\Rightarrow$ firms enter!




---


**Technical note:** Integer Problems


 - Sometimes the number of firms in the long run is not a whole number
 - Two solutions:
    1. Redefine equilibrium. No firm in the market makes losses and no additional firm can make a profit
    2. Make firms "infinitesimal" (negligibly small). Then $m^*$ represents a "mass" of firms (infinitely many points)

**Exercise**: Derive an equilibrium mathematically

Consider the following market: 
- 800 consumers with income $I$ maximise utility utility $\log(x)+m$ subject to the budget constraint $px+m=I$. 

- 200 suppliers with cost function $C(y)=y^2/2$.
