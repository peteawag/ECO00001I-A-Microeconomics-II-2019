## 4. Elasticities

---

### Demand Elasticity

- *elasticity* = sensitivity of demand changes in response to price changes

- How to measure? Slope of demand curve would work:
$$D'(p)=\frac{\Delta D(p)}{\Delta p}$$

- But then our measure of elasticity will depend on how we measure things (smaller units, larger change)

- Solution: measure changes **proportionally** in %

---

**Informal definition of demand elasticity**
<br>

$$\text{demand elasticty}=\frac{\text{\% change in demand}}{\text{\% change in price}}$$

In words: 

    The elasticity of demand is defined as the % change in demand resulting 
    from a price increase, divided by the % change in price


---

We distinguish between two measures of elasticity 
  - Arc-price elasticity: sensitivity of demand between two different prices 
  - Point-price elasticity: sensitivity of demand "locally" at a given price $p$


---
### Arc-price elasticity




**Definition**: The *arc-price elasticity* of a demand  $D$ between prices $p$ and $p'>p$ is 
$$
\epsilon_A(p,p')=\left|\frac{\left(\frac{D(p')-D(p)}{D(p)}\right)}{\left(\frac{p'-p}{p}\right)}\right|.
$$

Note: demand is decreasing, so we have $\epsilon(p)\in [0,\infty)$.

---

### Point-price elasticity




**Definition**: The *point-price elasticity* of a differentiable demand function $D$ at price $p$ is defined as
$$
\epsilon_P(p)=\lim_{p'\to p}\left|\frac{\left(\frac{D(p')-D(p)}{D(p)}\right)}{\left(\frac{p'-p}{p}\right)}\right|=\left|D'(p)\frac{p}{D(p)}\right|.
$$

Note: demand is decreasing, so we have $\epsilon(p)\in [0,\infty)$.

**Terminology:** Elastic vs inelastic demand

We call a demand function $D(p)$  ...

- ... elastic at $p$ if $\epsilon(p)>1$
- ... unit-elastic at $p$ if $\epsilon(p)=1$ 
- ... inelastic at $p$ if $\epsilon(p)<1$


---


### Supply Elasticity

Supply elasticity is defined in the same way as demand elasticity
<br>
$$\text{supply elasticty}=\frac{\text{\% change in supply}}{\text{\% change in price}}$$

- The definition of arc- and point-price elasticities are analogous to the demand case

---

**Exercises:** 
- Calculate the arc-price elasticity of the demand $D(p)=\max\{1-p,0\}$
- Derive the point-price elasticity of $D(p)=1/p^e$, where $e$ is an arbitrary positive number
- Calculate the arc-price elasticity of the supply function $S(p)=p^2$
