## 6. Taxes

### Taxes


- We now use the notions of consumer surplus to evaluate the effect of a goverment tax. 
- Quantity tax $t$: for any purchase of $q$ units, pay tax $t\cdot q$
- In equilibrium, consumers and producers face different prices:
  - Price paid by consumers: $\hat p_c$
  - Price paid by firms: $\hat p_f$
  - Price difference: $\hat p_c=\hat p_f+t$


---
**Equilibrium with taxation:**
- Tax is equivalent to a shift in demand or a shift in supply
- In equilibrium, markets must clear: 
  - quantity demanded by consumers must equal the quantity supplied by firms 
  - at the equilibrium quantity $q^*$, the difference between price paid by consumers and received by firms must equal the tax
$$
P^D(q^*)=P^S(q^*)+t
$$

What about surplus?

## Tax Incidence: who pays the tax? 

- The distribution of tax burden determined by relative elasticities of demand and supply
  - consumers bear more burden if demand more inelastic than supply
  - firms bear more burden if supply more inelastic than demand
- The higher the elasticity of demand and supply, the larger the deadweight loss

**Consumers bear burden when demand perfectly inelastic:**
