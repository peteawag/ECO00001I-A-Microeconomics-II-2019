## 6. Monopoly


---

### Monopoly

A *monopoly*  is a market for a good that is supplied by a single firm (from ancient greek *monopolion*, "a right of exclusive sale"), supplier in a monopoly is called a *monopolist*. 

**Examples of monopolists:**


  -  Microsoft, market for operating systems. Market share ' 90\%.
  -  Google: 70\% of US web searches, 70\% of online advertising market.
  -  Gillette, razor blades market, 72\% market share. 
  -  Utilities (electricity, water, telephone, rail, etc.)



---

### Monopoly profits


Market price at supply $q$ is $P^D(q)$. 

Monopolist's profits
$$
\pi_m(q)=P^D(q)q - C(q) .
$$





---
To solve for the optimal level of output,  solve the f.o.c. 
$$
\pi_m'(q)=\underbrace{\frac{d}{dq}P^{D}(q)q +P^D(q)}_{:=MR(q)} \ - c'(q)=0
$$

Denote the solution by $q_m$. 


---

### Properties of monopoly output

- Comparison with competitive equilibrium   

    - competitive equilibrium: output $q^*$ solve $MC(q)=P^D(q)$
    - monopoly output: output $q_m$ solves $MC(q)=MR(q)$ 

- Demand is decreasing $\frac{d}{dq}P^{D}(q)<0$, hence $MR(q)<P^D(q)$, 

- $\Rightarrow$ monopolist under-supplies the market: $q_m<q^*$!!

### Inverse Elastiticy Rule

Intuitively, a monopolist can exploit the fact that demand is inelastic.

The relationship between the profit for the monopolist and elasticity of demand s captured by the **Inverse Elasticity Rule**.

Consider the marginal revenue for the monopolist:
$$
(*) \ \ \ MR(q)=P^D(q) + P^{D'}(q)q= P^D(q) \Big(1 + {\color{red}\underbrace{P^{D'}(q)\frac{q }{P^D(q)}}_{=-1/\epsilon}}\Big)
$$

---


Since $P^D(q)$ is the inverse of $D(p)$:
$$D(P^D(q))=q\Rightarrow D'(P^D(q))P^{D'}(q)=1\Rightarrow P^{D'}(q)=\frac{1}{D'(P^D(q))}$$

Further, recall the definition of elasticity of demand

$$P^{D'}(q)\frac{q }{P^D(q)}=\frac{1}{D'(P^D(q))}\frac{D(p)}{p}=-\frac{1}{\epsilon(p)}$$


Substituting the first and then the second identity into into equation $(*)$ on the previous slide, we find 
$$(**)\ \ \ MR(q)=P^D(q) \left(1 - \frac{1}{\epsilon(P^D(q))}\right)$$



---
If we now substitute $(**)$ into the first-order condition for the monopolist's profit maximization problem, we have
$$
P^D(q) \left(1 -\frac{1}{\epsilon(P^D(q))}\right)=MC(q)
$$
If we now rearrange this equality, we obtain
$$
L:=\frac{P^D(q)-MC(q)}{P^D(q)}=\frac{1}{\epsilon(P^D(q))}
$$
This equation is known as the **inverse elasticity rule**.  The expression on the left-hand side is called the Lerner index and the difference $P^D(q)-MC(q)$ is the "mark-up". 

---

**Why do we need the inverse elasticity rule**?
 - Can be used to calculate monopoly price directly when elasticity of demand is known
 - Monopolist operates in elastic region of demand $(\epsilon>1)$! Why? 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\epsilon(P^D(q))}=\frac{P^D(q)-MC(q)}{P^D(q)} < 1&
\Longrightarrow\ 
\epsilon(P^D(q))>1
\end{aligned}
$$
*(Recall: When demand is inelastic, a price increase leads to a less than proportionate decrease in quantity demanded)*

### Two-Part Tariffs

- So far we assumed the monopolist sets a uniform price. 

- The monopolist can do better with so-called two-part tariffs!

- Basic idea: in addition to a per unit price, charge an upfront fee

- With a "two-part" tariff, the monopolist supplies the efficient amount

- BUT: the monopolist extracts the entire surplus!!


--- 

###  Optimal two-part tariff

- Principal supplies $q$ at price $p=P^D(q)$. 

- Consumer willing to pay $T\le CS(q)$ upfront. 

Optimal tariff
- Price equal to competitive price: $p^*$ $\rightarrow$ demand $q^*=D(p^*)$
- Fee equal to surplus $T^*=CS(q^*)$.

**Two-part tariff**

Monopolists extracts all surplus: 
1. Consumers demand efficient quantity
2. Monopolist is paid upfront

### Oligopoly: Cournot model



- Two symmetric firms that supply entire market. 
- Not price takers: they affect price through outputs
- Firms sets their outputs 
  - independently (no coordination)
  - simultaneously (cannot observe the choice of the other firm)

---

Profit of firm $i$:
$$\pi_i(q_1,q_2)=P^D(q_1+q_2)q_i-C(q_i)$$
<br>

**Market Equilibrium:** A Cournot Equilibrium is a pair of outputs $(q_1^*,q_2^*)$ such that output $q_1^*$ maximizes the profit of firm 1 given $q^*_2$, and vice versa.



---

### Linear Cournot

For simplicity, suppose we have an inverse demand function 
$$P^D(q)=a-bq$$
and linear cost $C(q)=c q$


---

The profit maximization problems of both firms are
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_{q_1} \big(a-b(q_1 + q_2^*)\big)q_1 - c q_1,\\
\max_{q_2} \big(a-b(q_1^* + q_2)\big)q_2 - c q_2.
\end{aligned}
$$


---






The first-order conditions associated with these maximization problems are
$$
\begin{aligned}
a-2bq_1^* - bq_2^* - c =0\Longrightarrow q_1=\frac{a-c-bq_2^*}{2b}\\
a-bq_1^* -2 bq_2^* - c =0\Longrightarrow q_2=\frac{a-c-bq_1^*}{2b}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Two find the Cournot equilibrium, we solve the second equation for $q_2^*$ and substitute in the first to solve for $q_1^*$. This yields the solution
$$
q^*:=q_1^*=q_2^*=\frac{a-c}{3b}.
$$

### Example: Cournot vs. Monopoly and Perfect Competition 


Suppose our demand function is $D(p)=8-p$ and firms have  zero cost $c(\cdot)=0$. 

<br>

**1. Competitive Equilibrium**

The competitive equilibrium price equal marginal cost: $p^*=0$. 

Total demand is $q^*=D(p^*)=8-0=8$.

The competitive equilibrium is $(p^*,q^*)=(0,8)$.


---
**2. Monopoly**

The monopolist solves
$$
\max_{q} \pi(q)=\big(8-q\big)q
$$

FOC is $\pi'(q)=8-2q_m=0$, so optimal quantity is $q_m=4$. 

Corresponding price is $p_m=P^D(4)=8-4=4$


Monopolist outcome $(p_m,q_m)=(4,4)$


---
**3. Cournot**

Cournot quanities are
$$q_1=q_2=\frac{8}{3}=2 \frac{2}{3}$$

Aggregate Supply is $q=2\times 2 \frac{2}{3}=5\frac{1}{3}$. 

Corresponding price is $p=P^D(5\frac{1}{3})=8-5\frac{1}{3}=2 \frac{2}{3}$


Monopolist outcome $(p,q)=(2 \frac{2}{3},5\frac{1}{3})$

## Review Questions

- What is the purpose of the Partial Equilibrium model?
- What is quasi-linear utility, and why do we use these types of preferences?
- What is the purpose of "elasticity", and why do we define it in terms of %-changes? 
- Why are surpluses the areas between demand and supply?
- What is the difference between efficiency and welfare?
- Why does a monopolist undersupply the market?
- What is the meaning of the "inverse elasticity rule"
- What is the difference between an oligopoly and a perfectly competitive market?
