# Learning Objectives
    
    - Understand the difference between General and Partial Equilibrium

    - Construct demand and supply functions in a Partial Equilibrium model

    - Understand basic properties of demand and supply and their meaning

    - Understand measures of market performance: surplus, welfare, efficiency

    - Implications of different modes of competition on market performance?
 -->


# Introduction


There are two ways in which economists have studied market economies:
- General equilibrium (Leon Walras): whole economy
- Partial Equilibrium (Alfred Marshall): a single sector in isolation

Here we study **Partial Equilibrium**:
 - Clearing of market for a **single** good independently from other markets. 
- Prices of substitutes and complements \& income levels of consumers  taken as given. 
- Surplus, welfare, comparative statics: all effects studied in one market in isolation

---


Partial equilibrium model much simpler than General Equilibrium Models.


**But:** Does not appropriately model real-world economic phenomena (cross-effects)

Differences to General Equilibrium: 
- No trade between consumers
- No trade between firms
- Consumers own "money" which they give to firms in exchange for goods

| |Partial Equilibrium| General Equilibrium|
|-|---|---|
| Developed by| Alfred Marshall| LÃ©on Walras|
| Considers| One good vs "everything else"| Whole Economy|
| Underlying Assumption | Markets for different goods independent    | Markets for different goods are interdependent. |
| Equilibrium| Price based on prices of other goods being constant| Prices of goods are determined simultaneously   |
| Pros| Tractable, welfare analysis and comparative statics feasible | More realistic|
| Cons| Some interactions are ignored | More difficult|
