## 5. Surplus and Welfare

### Surplus and Welfare

- How should we measure market performance and "gains from trade"?


- In his seminal book Principles of Economics (1890), Alfred Marshall  proposes to measure "surplus pleasure":

  > The price which a person pays for a thing can never exceed, and seldom comes up to that which he would be willing to pay rather than go without it [...]; and he thus derives from the purchase a surplus of pleasure. **The excess of the price which he would be willing to pay rather than go without it, over that which he actually does pay**, is the economic measure of this **surplus pleasure.** 

*(Alfred Marshall, 1890)*



---

In other words: consumer surplus are the consumers' **gains from trade**

For simplicity: infinitely many identical consumers of mass 1

Each consumer has utility $U(x,m)=u(x)+m$. 
- Utility of consumer with wealth $m$ and without trade: $u(0)+m$
- Utility of consumer with wealth $m$ who buys $x$ goods at price $p$: $u(x)+m-px$

Consumer surplus from such a trade at given price $p$:
$$CS(x)=u(x)-u(0)-px$$

**How can we illustrate consumer surplus in our diagrams?**
#


$$
\begin{aligned}
CS(x)&=u(x)-u(0)-px\\
&=\int_0^x(u'(q)-p)dq\\
&=\int_0^x(P^D(q)-p)dq\\
\end{aligned}
$$



**Lesson:**

    Consumer surplus at a given quantity and price, is the area bounded 
    above by the inverse demand curve and below by the horizontal price line

## Producer Surplus


The producer surplus is defined in a similar way. 

**Producer surplus:** profits = the revenue a firm receives from selling a good at a given price minus the cost of producing it

Since firms are price-takers, at a fixed price $p$, producer surplus at quantity $q$ is
$$PS(q)=pq-c(q)$$

---

Similar to the consumer surplus case, we can represent this in our standard diagrams.

Marginal profit is: 
$$PS'(q)=p-c'(q)$$

Recall from profit maximisation problem: $c'(q)=P^S(q)$ (recall that $P^S$ is the inverse supply function). Substitute
$$PS'(q)=p-P^S(q)$$

The total producer surplus is thus the area underneath the price line and above the inverse supply curve, up to total quantity: 
$$PS(\hat q)=\int_0^{\hat q}(p-P^S(q))dq$$

## Welfare 

The "welfare" generated in the market which is the total gains it generates. 

**Definition:** The **(Social) Welfare** is the sum of consumer and producer
$$W(q):=CS(q)+PS(q)$$

### Welfare: 

Welfare represents the sum of consumers surplus (utility gain) and producer surplus (profits)

**Exercises:** 

1. Calculate the consumer surplus for the demand functions
    - $D(p)=\max\{1-p,0\}$ 
    - $D(p)=\max\{\sqrt{1-p},0\}$
2. Calculate the producer surplus for the  supply function $S(p)=p^2$. 
3. For a given pair of demand and supply functions, at which price is welfare maximised?
